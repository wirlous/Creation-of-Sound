# Creation-of-Sound

Starting from basic techniques of creation, design and interactive manipulation of digitized sound, 
different areas of audio signal processing, performance and human-machine interaction will be further explored in 
order to incorporate it into musical and artistic performances. 
The different experiments can also be seen as simple recreational learning tools, 
with the aim of pushing forward the limits of music and sound, with the scope of . 

All the different experiments have been implemented using Pure Data as visual programming language in order to create 
and process the different sounds and audio, while Arduino has been used to create physical interfaces to 
control and manipulate Pure Data and physically interact with the different audio and sounds.
